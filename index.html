                        The employees of the restaurants are super. After a long time, someone greets me in Korean. The food taste was
                        beyond my expectation; their Kimchi side dish is just fantastic.

                        I love the way they served their food and the restaurant environment. I was in Dhaka for five days and ate at
                         Sura most of the time. For some reason could not adjust to Bangladeshi local food.

                        I was surprised to see how they make Hotteok. I went to Sura with one of my Bangladeshi friends. She loves
                        the test even brought a few portions for her kids at home. I bet they love it too.
